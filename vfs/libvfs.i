%feature("docstring") FileMapping
" 
    Most of the time (with a few exceptions), nodes in DFF are associated with a set of meta-data
    and a content. For example, a file system driver will parse the real file system of a dump
    or device and then create one node for each files and directories. These files are associated
    with content, such as pictures, text, videos, etc. The content of a file is located somewhere
    on the dump and can be found by following the file system specification. For each modules, the
    specification is different so file content position will be different.

    As far as each file systems and dumps do not have the same specification and content, it is necessary
    to have a standard way to represent their content position in DFF.

    The FileMapping class is used to give this standard way to describe file content positions on the dump.
    So when the file is opened its content can be displayed in DFF interface using a viewer.
    File content can be fragmented on the disk so generally there are several chunks to describe the
    entire content of a file, especially on big files.

    More precisely, the FileMapping class contains a list of chunks giving the different offsets
    of the file blocks on the vfile. Each chunks are used to describe one of these different positions on the vfile
    by providing two informations :
        * the offset of the data on the vfile
        * the size it occupies
    
    In other words, the chunk's list will, for each areas the file occupies, give its begining offset and its size.
    We could say something like :
     * The file `foo` first chunk start at offset 0x42 and occupies 10 bytes.
     * The second chunk of `foo` file starts at offset 0x84 and occupies 20 bytes.
     * etc.
     
    For example, lets imagine we open a 100 bytes big node which is fragmented in
    three parts. When mapping the file, three chunks will be created and will look
    like this :
        * chunk 1 => offset : x; size : s bytes
        * chunk 1 => offset : y; size : t bytes
        * chunk 1 => offset : z; size : u bytes
    
    The sum `s + t + u` should be equal to the file size (100 bytes in our example).
    The \"main\" method of FileMapping class is push, which must be called to
    create the different chunks. This method muts be called in the Node::fileMapping method,
    which is called by DFF when the node is opened.
"

%feature("docstring") FileMapping::mappedFileSize
"
        Return the total size of the different chunks. Should be equal to the node
        size.
"

%feature("docstring") FileMapping::chunkCount

"

        Return a pointer on the chunk structure corresponding to index `idx`

"

        Return a pointer to the chunk in which offset `offset` is.
"


%feature("docstring") fso
"
The fso or 'File System Object' class is the base class of the API. All
modules must inheritates it (or inherit mfso, which itself inherit fso). It provides
several virtual methods which must be reimplemented, such as start, vopen, vread, vwrite, 
vclose and vseek. They are used to read, open, write and seek within the content
of a node.
        
The start method does the job the module is supposed to do. This is the method which is
called when a module is launched.

The main difference between fso and mfso is the fact that the open, read and seek method
are pure virtual in fso and virtual in mfso. Indeed, using the fso class rather than
the mfso class, where implentations of open and read are provided, supposes that the
developer of the module does not wish to use the FileMapping system.

The behaviour, use and prototype of methods open, read and seek are pretty similar to their
UNIX equivalent. The vwrite method is generally not used, and even left empty in modules implementations.

"

%feature("docstring") fso::start
"
        This method is called when the module starts. It does the job the module
        is supposed to do. This method is declared as a pure virtual so each modules
        must reiplements it (see the developer's documentations for more details) in
        python or C++, depending on which language you choose.

        The parameter 'args' is a pointer to the arguments list which were passed to the
        module when it was launched. You can get them by using the method
         args->get(\"arg_name\", &variable)
        where variable must be of the same type than the argument \"arg_name\"

        If you create nodes, you must not forget to call the method register_tree at
        the end of the module execution.

        If an error occured while getting a parameter, a envError exception is thrown.

        Params :
                * args : the list of arguments passed to the module.

"
 
%feature("docstring") fso::vopen
"
        Open a node.

        Param :
                * n : the node you want to open

        Return the opened file descriptor, or 0 if it failed.
"

%feature("docstring") fso::vread
"
        vread(self, int32_t fd, void rbuff, uint32_t size) -> int32_t

        Perform readings on an open node and returns the number of bytes which wereread.

        Params :
                * fd : the file descriptor of the node you want to read on.
                * rbuff : a pointer to an allocated buffer where the read bytes will be stored
                * size : the number of characters you want to read.

        Return the number of read characters.
"

%feature("docstring") fso::vwrite
"
Not used.
"

%feature("docstring") fso::vclose
"
Close an open file descriptor and make it available again for others
openings.

Return `0` if everything went fine, `0` otherwise.
"

%feature("docstring") fso::vseek
"
        vseek(self, int32_t fd, uint64_t offset, int32_t whence) -> uint64_t

        This method is used to change position within an open node (i.e. modifies the
        offset of the current position). The offset is set to 0 when the file is open.

        Throws a vfsError if something goes wrong (typically if the seeking position is
        after the end of the file).

        It takes three parameters :
                * a file descriptor of an open node
                * the offset where you want to seek
                * the third parameter is optional : it defines if the offset passed in second parameter is absolute or relative.

        Return an uint64_t
"

%feature("docstring") fso::status
"
Return the status of the module.
"

%feature("docstring") fso::vtell
"
Returns the current offset in a file.
"

%feature("docstring") fso::setVerbose
"

        in production environment.

        Params :
                * verbose : the verbosity
"

%feature("docstring") fso::verbose
"
        Return `true` if the module is in verbose mode, `false` otherwise.
"

%feature("docstring") mfso
"
The mfso purpose has pretty the same role as the fso one. It inheritates fso.

The main difference is based on the file mapping : the fso class
do not use file mapping, mfso uses it. The mfso class provides implementations
for the vopen, vread and vseek methods and a file descriptor manager (which not
the case in the fso interface). It provides an abstraction of the node's content
to developers, making the code easier to write.

File mapping is detailed in libvfs.fileMapping.
"

%feature("docstring") mfso::start
"
        start(self, argument args)

        This method is pure virtual in mfso so musts be implemented while developing
        a module.
        
        This method is called when the module starts. It does the job the module
        is supposed to do. This method is declared as a pure virtual so each modules
        must reiplements it (see the developer\'s documentations for more details) in
        python or C++, depending on which language you choose.

        The parameter \'args\' is pointer to the arguments list which were passed to the

        the end of the module execution.

        If an error occured while getting a parameter, a envError exception is thrown.

        Params :
                * args : the list of arguments.

"
  
%feature("docstring") mfso::open
"
Open the node `n`.

Params :
        * n : the node you want to open.

to reimplement it.
"

%feature("docstring") mfso::vread
"
        Perform readings on an open node and returns the number of bytes which were read.
        The reading is performed at the current offset on the file. If the user tries
        to read more bytes that they are in the file, read will stop reading at the
        end of the file and return the actual number of read characters.

        Params :
                * fd : the file descroiptor of the node you want to read on.
                * buff : a pointer to an allocated buffer where the read bytes will be stored
                * size : the number of characters you want to read.

        Throw a vfsError if something goes wrong.
